                    	<p><img src="images/img2.jpg" style="float:left; margin-right:2%;" /><strong>How does a Chit Work?</strong>
                        <p>
                        • <strong>CHIT</strong> is a financial product which blends the advantages of both investment and borrowing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        • <strong>Concept:</strong> Under a Chit, a group of persons join together to contribute specific sum of money periodically (monthly contribution is most common). The individual/institution who/that has undertaken the responsibility of the organizing and conducting the Chit and assumes the associated responsibilities and risks is called ‘<strong>Foreman’</strong>. The other persons who contribute the money periodically are known as <strong>‘Subscribers’</strong>. The money paid by all the subscribers every month or in any periodical interval will be pooled together which is called as <strong>‘Chit Value’</strong> and all the subscribers have right to bid for the chit amount by means of open auction conducted for the purpose. The subscribers who are willing for bidding the chit amount have to be prepared to forego a portion of the total amount to which he is otherwise eligible for and that portion is known as the <strong>'Discount'</strong>. The maximum bidding percentage will be 40% of the Chit value and minimum is 5% of the chit value which is Foreman’s commission. This foregone amount by the subscriber is utilized to distribute among all the subscribers of the chit group in proportion to their tickets in the form of <strong>'Dividend'</strong>, after deducting 5% of the Chit value towards Forman's Commission. The successful bidder is called as <strong>‘Prized Subscriber’</strong>. The money which the prized subscriber is eligible for minus the discount forgone is called <strong>‘prize money’</strong> which will be disbursed to the prized subscriber after he/she produces the adequate security for the future liability as per the Company norms. This process is being repeated every month and every month there will be one prized subscriber. The prized subscriber has to continue paying the installments till the termination of the chit.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Those members who do not want to bid and want to just contribute to the chit till the end can do so. When there are no bidders for any particular auction, one of the non-prized subscribers will be picked as Successful Bidder through lucky draw. The monthly dividends accrued for the whole duration of the chit are the returns on investment for the monthly deposit made to their accounts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        • In case of <strong>‘GEO Chits’</strong>, <strong>GEO</strong> is the ‘<strong>Foreman’</strong> and is the First Subscriber of every group.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        • Chit Groups with different denomination and value will be started from time to time as per the demand from the public.
                         </p>
                        <p>
                        • The number of subscribers in each group will be equal to duration of the Chit. For ex: 25 months chit will have 25 subscribers .
                        </p>
                        <p>  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                 	<strong>Security Norms</strong><br /><br />
                   	The Prized subscriber/successful bidder shall provide security of any one of the following types either single or in combination to the satisfaction of the Company.<br /><br />
                   	<strong>1) Immovable Property:</strong> Property of the prized subscriber or a third party Guarantor situated within Corporation limit is accepted as security. Gram Panchayat/Agricultural properties and also property having B-Khatha will not be accepted. The procedure is as below <br /><br />
			Subscribers must <strong>submit</strong> photocopy of all the relevant papers of the property to the concerned branch. These papers will be subjected to <strong>preliminary scrutinization</strong> by the concerned Foreman. Once the documents are found ok with basic eligibility, subscribers will be intimated to submit the original papers and same will be forwarded to our empanelled Advocate for detailed verification and <strong>Legal Opinion</strong>. Upon obtaining positive legal opinion, <strong>Valuation</strong> of the property will be done by our empanelled valuer and spot inspection will be conducted by the Foreman to assess the value and acceptability of the property. Only 50% of the market value as given by the Valuer in his report will be considered by the Company. Once the Legal Opinion and Valuation is over, Registered Mortgage of Title Deeds will be done at the Sub-registrar’s office after getting clearance from the Head Office.<br /><br />
			Subscriber must pay the charges towards documentation, Legal Opinion and Valuation of the property to the company. Applicable stamp duty and other related charges for mortgage registration must also be borne by the subscriber at the sub-registrar’s office. <br /><br />
			This whole process beginning from preliminary scrutinization to mortgage registration may take at least 15 -20 days time to complete and hence subscribers must plan properly and ensure that the property papers are acceptable even before bidding to avoid delay in receiving prized money.<br /><br />
			However it is the sole discretion of the <strong>‘GEO Chits’</strong> to accept or reject any property based on the factors like location, saleability etc even if the owner has got the valid title over the property and legal opinion is clear.<br /><br />
			<strong> 2) LIC Policy:</strong> The subscriber needs to obtain Surrender Value certificate of the Policy from LIC of India. The surrender value only will be considered by <strong>‘GEO Chits’</strong> and not the sum assured. The surrender value of the policy must be sufficient enough to secure the future liability/installments to be paid. The subscriber must get the policy assigned from LIC in favour <strong>‘GEO Chits’</strong> and upon receiving the assignment confirmation from the LIC, file will be processed to disburse the prize money. The original policy along with surrender value certificate will be held by the company. The subscriber should continue to remit premium in respect of the insurance policy without default.<br /><br />
			In case of unit linked policies (market plus, money plus etc), only 50% of the surrender value will be considered as it fluctuates depending up on the market conditions.<br /><br />
			Insurance policies of the private insurance companies will not be accepted.<br /><br />
			<strong>3) Fixed Deposits:</strong> Fixed Deposits of any Nationalized/Scheduled/banks approved by the company will be accepted as security. The face value of the FD must be sufficient enough to secure the future liability. The deposits shall be in the name of the subscriber or in the name of any other person. The Lien in favour of <strong>‘GEO	Chits’</strong> need to be noted in the bank’s records and same should be written on the original FD receipt by the bank. The original FD receipt will be held by the company.<br /><br />
			<strong>4) Bank Guarantee:</strong> Bank Guarantee from any Nationalized/Scheduled/banks approved by the company in the format prescribed by the company equivalent to the future liability will be accepted as security. Such Bank Guarantees will have to be confirmed by the concerned Regional/Circle office. The expiry date of the bank guarantee shall be 3 months after the termination date of the Chit group.<br /><br />
			<strong>5) Non-Prized Pass Books:</strong> The paid-up amount in the Non-prized pass books (Gross Installment amount remitted minus Foreman’s commission of 5% oh the chit amount) will be accepted as security. The paid-up amount should exceed future liability amount plus interest at 18% P.A. till the termination of the non-prized Chit offered as security. The non-prized passbook shall be in the name of the prized subscriber or any other person.<br /><br />
			The non-prized passbook should be pledged in favour of the company and the same will held by the company until the liability in the prized chit is fully cleared.<br /><br />
			The Non-prized Chit will be allowed to be auctioned only after the pledge is cancelled by the company.<br /><br />
